# Drum Kit Project

This JavaScript project implements a virtual drum kit, allowing users to play various drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Sounds**: The program produces different drum sounds corresponding to each button clicked or key pressed.
- **Button Click Event Listeners**: Event listeners are attached to each drum button, triggering the appropriate drum sound when clicked.
- **Keyboard Key Event Listeners**: Users can also trigger drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard.
- **Button Animation**: A visual animation effect is applied to each drum button when clicked or pressed, providing feedback to the user.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser to start the drum kit application.
2. Click on the drum buttons with your mouse or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play drum sounds.
3. Enjoy creating rhythmic beats and experimenting with different combinations of drum sounds.

## Drum Sounds

The drum sounds used in the project are stored as audio files in the `sounds` directory. Each drum sound corresponds to a specific button or key, as follows:

- `w`: Tom-1
- `a`: Tom-2
- `s`: Tom-3
- `d`: Tom-4
- `j`: Snare
- `k`: Crash
- `l`: Kick-bass

## Button Animation

When a button is clicked or a key is pressed, a visual animation effect is applied to the corresponding drum button to provide feedback to the user. The animation adds a temporary "pressed" class to the button, which is removed after a short delay.
